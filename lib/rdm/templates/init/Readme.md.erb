# My Awesome App



This application is using [RDM](https://github.com/droidlabs/rdm) to structure different parts of your application.
Rdm adds the missing layer of separation that is very lightweight and additional to Bundler.

Applications managed with Rdm can be packaged as single or as multiple interdependent Ruby applications with ease and as little friction as possible. When you ever tried to split up your main application into different Ruby gems, you will greatly appreciate Rdm:
  - no self-hosted Rubygems repositories needed
  - no conflicting Gems - RDM packages share a single Gemfile with lazily-loaded gems
  - arbitrary folder structures without nesting lots of Ruby module definitions
  - clear dependencies between your application packages, with different environments

Rdm-Apps lend themselves to be used in conjunction with DDD, a technology-agnostic methodology that works much better than CRUD / MVC for more complex requirements.


### Recommended Gems to use in combination with Rdm are:

  - [smart_ioc](https://github.com/droidlabs/smart_ioc) - Really convenient dependency injection library
  - [contracts-lite](https://github.com/ddd-ruby/contracts-lite) - Define clear contracts for your Ruby methods
  - [activesupport]() - this is mainly used to enable lazy-loading for constants
  - [sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) - a very flexible Database toolkit
  - [hcast](https://github.com/AlbertGazizov/hcast) - a lightweight datacaster for datastructures from external systems
  - [attr_validator](https://github.com/AlbertGazizov/attr_validator) - a simple library to validate ruby objects
